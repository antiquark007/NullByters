This program is a device discovery and inventory tool that scans for block storage devices on a Linux system. Here's what it does step by step:

Program Overview
The program creates a JSON inventory of all block devices (hard drives, SSDs, etc.) while excluding the system boot disk to avoid accidentally targeting the operating system drive.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Boot Disk Detection

char *get_boot_disk()
Uses findmnt command to find the root filesystem (/)
Extracts the parent device name (PKNAME)
Constructs the full device path (e.g., sda)
This disk will be excluded from the inventory
2. Initialize udev Context
Creates a udev context to interact with the Linux device manager
udev provides detailed information about hardware devices
3. Device Enumeration

udev_enumerate_add_match_subsystem(enumerate, "block");
Scans for all devices in the "block" subsystem
Block devices include hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, etc.
4. Device Filtering
For each found device:

Type check: Only includes devices with devtype="disk" (excludes partitions)
Boot disk exclusion: Skips the system boot disk identified in step 1
Path validation: Ensures the device has a valid dev path
5. Attribute Collection
For each valid device, gathers:

Path: Device node (e.g., sdb)
Model: Manufacturer model name
Serial: Serial number or WWN identifier
Bus: Connection type (SCSI, SATA, USB, etc.)
Size: Both in blocks (512-byte sectors) and total bytes
6. JSON Output Generation
Creates a JSON array containing all discovered devices
Each device becomes a JSON object with the collected attributes
Writes the formatted JSON to device_inventory.json
Purpose
Looking at your current inventory, this appears to be designed for data recovery or forensic analysis:

sda is likely your boot disk (excluded)
sdb, sdc, sdd are target storage devices
Loop and RAM devices are also cataloged
The program safely identifies non-system storage that could be analyzed or recovered without risking the host operating system.
