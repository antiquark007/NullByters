It leverages raylib for cross-platform graphics and Go for efficient, reliable performance, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Data Wiping**: Implements NIST SP 800-88 compliant Clear, Purge methods with zero fill, random fill, and cryptographic erase options.
- **Real-Time Device Detection**: Automatically enumerates and identifies storage devices with system drive protection.
- **Certificate Management**: Generates PDF/JSON certificates with digital signatures, QR code integration, and cloud upload capabilities.
- **Interactive GUI**: Native raylib-based interface with real-time wiping progress visualization and certificate previews.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs natively on Windows, Linux, and macOS with consistent performance.
- **Compliance Logging**: Maintains audit trails for regulatory compliance.
